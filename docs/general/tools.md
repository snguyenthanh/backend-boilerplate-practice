# Configuration: A Glossary

A guide to the configuration files for this project: where they live and what they do.

## The root folder

- `.gitignore`: Tells `git` to ignore certain files and folders which don't need to be version controlled, like the build folder.

- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: Lists the hooks to be ran against your git commit, using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com). The hooks include (but not limited to) linters, detect debug statements and bandit vulnerability check.

- `.travis.yml`: Continuous Integration configuration.  
  - This boilerplate uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com), but feel free to swap either out for your own choice of CI.  
  - It sets up testing environment for the project under [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com) (including different Python versions of 3.6, 3.7, etc.) for `tox` to run the tests.


- `poetry.lock`: generated by `poetry`. It describes the exact dependency tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.

- `pyproject.toml`: Our `poetry` configuration file, which has (nearly) the same functionalities as `npm` and `pipenv`. It has three functions:
  1. It's where the requirements of platforms and Python implementations are configured.
  2. It's the API for the project: a consistent interface for all its controls.
  3. It manages the project's package dependencies.
  4. Create and manage a virtual environment containg all the dependencies.  

  See [this explanation](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry#why) by `Poetry`'s author on why he prefers not to use `pipenv`.


- `tox.ini`: A configuration for [Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest) - a tool to running the tests in different environments and Python implementations/versions.  
It also supports [coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io) and linters (such as [black](https://github.com/psf/black), [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) and [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)).  
A more practical example is [the Travis build of this repository](https://travis-ci.org/snguyenthanh/backend-boilerplate-practice).
